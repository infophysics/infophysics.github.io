I'm a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California at Davis working primarily on the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).  I mainly work on developing novel approaches to machine learning and topological data analysis in physics, e.g. in the DUNE experiment.  I recieved my PhD in physics from the [University at Albany](https://www.albany.edu/) in May 2021.
