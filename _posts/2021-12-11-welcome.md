Welcome to my blog.

I've constructed this space to post discussions about physics, machine learning (ML), topological data analysis (TDA) and their intersection.  My goal is to write at least two blog posts a week, one on machine learning and the other on TDA.  Each of these posts will be part of an ongoing series which aims to produce tutorials and practical examples pertaining to physics.  I'll try and add a comments section so people can leave feedback (which will be much appreciated).  The code for each of these will live in some github repositories that are linked on the side bar -- the machine learning one is called [machine_learning_tutorials](https://github.com/infophysics/machine_learning_tutorials) and the TDA one is (as you guessed it) [tda_tutorials]().
