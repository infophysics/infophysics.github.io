Welcome to my blog.

I've constructed this space to post discussions about physics, machine learning (ML), topological data analysis (TDA) and their intersection.  My goal is to write at least two blog posts a week, one on machine learning and the other on TDA.  Each of these posts will be part of an ongoing series which aims to produce tutorials and practical examples pertaining to physics.  I'll try and add a comments section so people can leave feedback (which will be much appreciated).  The code for each of these will live in some github repositories that are linked on the side bar -- the machine learning one is called [machine_learning_tutorials](https://github.com/infophysics/machine_learning_tutorials) and the TDA one is (as you guessed it) [tda_tutorials](https://github.com/infophysics/tda_tutorials).

Most of the code I'll post here will either be c++ or python.  The neural network library I like using
is [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)),
although there are plenty of other machine learning tools that I often utilize from other libraries such 
as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Some of the motivation for this blog is to force myself to become more acquainted with other libraries
such as [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) and others.  To be
honest, my [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) skills aren't all that great either.  In any case, this
is really a learning experience for me, but if anyone gets anything out of it, that's great too.

I wonder how good the syntax highlighting is with the markdown interpreter.  Will it recognize more 
modern python stuff, like decorators?
{% highlight python linenos %}
from decorators import do_twice

@do_twice
def f(
    x:  float,
    y:  float,
) -> float:
    """Function which returns 2 * (x + y)"""
    return x + y
{% endhighlight %}
